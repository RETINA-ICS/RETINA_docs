The PECAN code A bundle of R packages that handle processing and preparing the data collected from the app and other sources to use it as model inputs or compare with model outputs reading model outputs and preparing them for visualizations, comparison with collected data and further analysis For each model that is used in the RETINA project, there is a specific R PEcAn package that contains (at minimum) script for preparing climate data for the model script(s) for preparing configuration (i.e. parameterization) files for the model script to execute the model script to read the output of the model and translate it from model specific format in to a standardized format so that it can be easily comparible with other model outputs The RETINA R package A series of helper scripts written in R that are specific to the RETINA project and JHI and thus shouldn’t be merged back in with the pecan project These scripts complement the tasks listed more generally with the PECAN code. The BETY database PSQL database. While BETY does house some data, it is better to think of it as a metadatabase that primarily holds information on the location and format of data The BETY database is used to track the full provinance of all data used when a model run is generated by the RETINA app including: records of all raw data and processed data used for drivers, parameterization and benchmarking (for every step of processing) records of run settings and model specific parameterization for model runs records of model run status and output files "],["where-the-code-and-data-live.html", "3 Where the code and data live 3.1 Overall structure 3.2 The HPC (Gruffalo) 3.3 The Retina VM (and getting there from gruffalo) 3.4 Overview of Docker container 3.5 The RETINA app Docker container 3.6 The RETINA app user database Docker container 3.7 The PEcAn Docker container 3.8 The RStudio server Docker container 3.9 The BETY database Docker container 3.10 The model Docker containers", " 3 Where the code and data live i.e. Understanding the HPC, the RETINA VM and Docker 3.1 Overall structure need to fix diagram 3.2 The HPC (Gruffalo) HPC documentation 3.3 The Retina VM (and getting there from gruffalo) What is available on the VM vs gruffalo 3.4 Overview of Docker container Remake with our logos like pecan and rstudio: 3.5 The RETINA app Docker container 3.5.1 php code 3.5.2 API this might not be the right place to talk about the API … 3.6 The RETINA app user database Docker container 3.7 The PEcAn Docker container 3.7.1 PEcAn 3.8 The RStudio server Docker container 3.9 The BETY database Docker container and where files are stored on gruffalo / how they are seen on docker: 3.10 The model Docker containers (and where the dockerfiles live / setting everything up through pecan) ESPECIALLY REBUILDING DNDC! 3.10.1 DNDC 3.10.2 BASGRA 3.10.3 ECOSSE "],["the-scary-diagram..html", "4 The scary diagram.", " 4 The scary diagram.

This can be found in the retina database and is associatedwith the retina run id. Look at the retina run table: - If the run completed, the run will have a “finished at” date and a record for “out folder” this folder contians the output visulaizations, not the data itself however. - To see the actual data, use the retina_run_id to find the bety workflow_id in the pecan_model_runs table. Again, if the run didn’t complete, this record won’t exist. - Then either use this workflow id to determine the path manually - For example: - retina_run_id 198 - workflow_id: 99000001015 - output directory: /mnt/shared/projects/joint/202012_RETINA/pecan/volumes/pecan/pecan/workflows/PEcAn_99000001015 Alternatively, query the bety database for this path. It is the folder field in the workflows table. You could even do a joint query. Something along the lines of this if you queried from both databases: SELECT w.folder FROM workflows w LEFT JOIN pecan_model_runs p WHERE w.id = p.workflow_id Following this example of workflow 99000001015, inside this directory there is an out folder and then another layer of subdirectories. This is because the system has the potential to do ensemble runs. Then there would be multiple directories, each containing the output from a unique model run. As we are not running ensembles right now, there is only one sub directory. PEcAn_99000001015/out/99000000889/ This is where you will find the output of the run, for a single model and site. The output is separated in to annual files and is in netcdf format.

The goal is to document all the ways that DNDC is being used across the group, and create a repository of code and documentation for each version of the model that is being used. For now the documentation centers around the version of DNDC that has been integrated in to PEcAn, which I am calling DNDC_M or DNDC “Matthias,” the most recently developed version of the sourcecode for N-DNDC. 10.1 Versions of DNDC Currently the RETINA group is working with the following versions of DNDC Agro-ecosystems: Crop yield, soil carbon sequestration, nitrogen leaching, and trace gas emissions The DNDC Model (Version 9.5) with PC User interface Interface: YES Model with interface: http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/model/DNDC95.zip Documentation: http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/model/GuideDNDC95.pdf Scientific Documentation: pdf provided by Ed (where is it online?)

However, even if the other versions of DNDC do not look exactly the same, the approaches to using them should be similar. 10.2.1 The DNDC interface (Difficutly: Easy) The simplest way to choose the parameters for the DNDC model is to use the interface for DNDC. After choosing one’s land type, soil type and crop type, most essential parameters will be populated with presets and it will be possible to do a preliminary run to see if the model is working. For information on using the interface to DNDC95, look at the documentation on DNDC95. 10.2.2 Library Parameter Files (Difficutly: Moderate) Reading in default parameters from lookup tables based on crop id and soil type #### Crop Params 10.2.2.1 Soil Params 10.2.2.2 ?
